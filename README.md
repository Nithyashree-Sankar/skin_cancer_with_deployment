# skin_cancer_with_deployment
In this Repo, a deep learning code was written to identify skin cancer.
Transfer learning means taking the relevant parts of a pre-trained deep learning model and applying it to a new but similar problem. This will usually be the core information for the model to function, with new aspects added to the model to solve a specific task
The transfer learning model which was used here is VGG19
